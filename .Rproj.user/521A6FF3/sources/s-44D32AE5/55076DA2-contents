```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

3 separate datasets were used to create the final dataset. The first is in the package Ecdat, and is called "breaches". This dataset was created by the US Department of Health and Human Services. There are many variables in this dataset, but for my analysis, only 'State' was used. Another variable was created called 'Cyber' that summed up the total number of security breaches by state. The second dataset used was "USstateAbbreviations" in order to convert the 2 letter stae code from the "breaches" dataset into the full name of the state. The last dataset is in the package Datasets, and is called "USArrests". This dataset measured 4 variables per state. 'Murder' is the number of murder arrests per 100,000 individuals. 'Assault' is the number of assault arrests per 100,000 individuals. 'UrbanPop' is the percentage of the population that is urban. 'Rape' is the number of rape arrests per 100,000 individuals. These specific datasets were used because I want to see if there is any relationship between cyber security attacks and violent crimes by state.

```{R}
library(Ecdat)
library(tidyverse)
?breaches
breaches <- breaches
breaches1 <- breaches %>% group_by(State) %>% select ("Number", "State") %>%na.omit() %>% summarize(Cyber=length(Number))
USstateAbbreviations <- USstateAbbreviations %>% select ("Name", "ANSI.letters")
data1 <- inner_join(breaches1, USstateAbbreviations, by=c("State"= "ANSI.letters" )) %>% rename(Abbreviation=State, State=Name)

library(datasets)
?USArrests
USArrests <- USArrests
data2 <- USArrests %>% as.data.frame %>% mutate(State=rownames(USArrests))
``` 

The data sets were then joined together using 'inner_join'. This function automatically joins by the 'State' column since both datasets have that variable. And, inner_join specifically was used because the first data set included data for Washington DC and Puerto Rico, while the second data set did not. Thus, inner_join allows R to automatically combine the data for the 50 states and omit DC and Puerto Rico.
```{R}
fulldata <- inner_join(data1, data2) %>% select(State, Cyber, Murder, Rape, UrbanPop, Assault)
``` 

Next, a categorical binary variable was created. States that had urban populations greater than the median were classified under the 'Size' variable as "Big". States that had urban populations less than the median were classified as "Small".
```{R}
fulldata <- fulldata %>% mutate(Size=ifelse(UrbanPop>median(UrbanPop), "Big", "Small"))
``` 

Next, the filter() functoin was used to further examine the full dataset.
```{R}
fulldata %>% filter(Cyber==max(Cyber))
fulldata %>% filter(Murder==max(Murder))
``` 

This output tells us that the state with the highest number of cybersecurity breaches is California. The state with the highest murder rate is Georgia.

Next, summary statistics were calculated for the numeric variables on the whole dataset.
```{R}
fulldata %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% summarize_all(.funs=list("mean"=mean,"median"=median,"sd"=sd, var="var", min="min", max="max",n_distinct="n_distinct"), na.rm=T)%>%pivot_longer(contains("_"))%>%separate(name,sep="_",into=c("variable","stat"))%>%pivot_wider(names_from = "variable",values_from="value")%>%arrange(stat)
``` 

The median assault rate is higher than the median rate for any of the other crimes in this dataset. Assault also has the most variation from state to state. Murder has the lowest median rate.

Next, summary statistics were calculated on the numeric variables after grouping by 'Size'.
```{R}
#Summary Stats after grouping by Size
fulldata %>% group_by(Size) %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% summarize_all(.funs=list("mean"=mean,"median"=median,"sd"=sd, var="var", min="min", max="max",n_distinct="n_distinct"), na.rm=T)%>%pivot_longer(contains("_"))%>%separate(name,sep="_",into=c("variable","stat"))%>%pivot_wider(names_from = "variable",values_from="value")%>%arrange(Size)

#Correlation Matrix
fulldata%>%select_if(is.numeric) %>% cor()
``` 
From the correlation matrix, we can see that cyber security breaches had the highest correlation with UrbanPop, and the lowest correlation with Murder. Overall, Assault and Murder are the best correlated, while urbanPop and Murder had the weakest correlation.

```{R}
fulldata %>% group_by(Size) %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% summarize_all(.funs=list("mean"=mean,"median"=median,"sd"=sd, var="var", min="min", max="max",n_distinct="n_distinct"), na.rm=T)%>%pivot_longer(contains("_"))%>%separate(name,sep="_",into=c("variable","stat"))%>%pivot_wider(names_from = "variable",values_from="value")%>%arrange(Size)

#Correlation Matrix
fulldata%>%select_if(is.numeric) %>% cor()
``` 

#Visualizing

A correlation heatmap of the numeric variables was created. 
```{R}
fulldata %>%select_if(is.numeric) %>% cor() %>% as.data.frame %>% rownames_to_column() %>%pivot_longer(-1) %>% ggplot(aes(rowname,name,fill=value))+geom_tile()+geom_text(aes(label=round(value,2)))+scale_fill_gradient2(low="red",high="blue")+ggtitle("Plot 1: Correlation Heat Map of Numeric Variables")
``` 
From the heatmap, we can see that the weakest correlation is between 'UrbanPop' and 'Murder'. 'Assault' and 'Murder' had the highest correlation.

The data was then visualized using a second plot.
```{R}
library(ggplot2)
fulldata %>% ggplot(aes(x=Cyber,y=Murder))+
  geom_point(aes(color=UrbanPop))+ggtitle("Plot 2: Murders vs Cyber Security Breaches")+xlab("Cyber Security Breaches")+ylab("Murder Rate per 100,000")+theme(legend.position=c(.9,.2))
``` 

There seems to be a positive relationship between cybersecurity breaches and the murder rate. Urban population, represented by the color of the points, does not seem to have a relationship with either cyber security breaches or the murder rate of the state. There are a couple outliers that have extremely high cyber security breaches.

The data was then visualized using a third plot.
```{R}
fulldata %>% ggplot(aes(x=Murder, y=Assault))+geom_point(aes(color=Rape, stat="summary"))+ggtitle("Plot 3: Assaults vs Murders")+xlab("Murders per 100,000")+ylab("Assaults per 100,000")+scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 350, 50))+scale_color_gradient(low="yellow", high="red")
``` 

This plot visualizes the number of assaults versus the amount of murders per 100,000 individuals in the population. From this, we can see that there is a positive relationship between murders and assaults. Additionally, the rapes are visualized by the color of the points. The red dots indicate higher rape rates, while the yellow dots indicate lower rape rates. We can see that rape is positively correlated with both assault and urban population.

#5 Dimensionality Reduction
```{R}
library(cluster)

gower1<-fulldata %>% select("Cyber", "Murder", "Rape", "UrbanPop", "Assault") %>% daisy(metric="gower")

sil_width<-vector()
for(i in 2:10){
  pam_fit <- pam(gower1, diss = TRUE, k = i)
  sil_width[i] <- pam_fit$silinfo$avg.width
}
ggplot()+geom_line(aes(x=1:10,y=sil_width))+scale_x_continuous(name="k",breaks=1:10)+ggtitle("Silhouette Width vs. k")
``` 

From this ggplot, we can see that the largest sil_width occurs when k=2. A larger silhoutte width is good because it's more cohesive and separated. Thus, the ideal number of clusters for this dataset is 2.

```{R}
pam3<-pam(gower1,k=2,diss=T)
plot(pam3,which=2)
``` 

From this plot, we see that the average silhouette width is 0.42. Thus, this structure is weak and could be artificial.
