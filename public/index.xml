      <description>3 separate datasets were used to create the final dataset. The first is in the package Ecdat, and is called “breaches”. This dataset was created by the US Department of Health and Human Services. There are many variables in this dataset, but for my analysis, only ‘State’ was used. Another variable was created called ‘Cyber’ that summed up the total number of security breaches by state. The second dataset used was “USstateAbbreviations” in order to convert the 2 letter stae code from the “breaches” dataset into the full name of the state.</description>
